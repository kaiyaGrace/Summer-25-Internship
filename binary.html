    <h3>What is Binary?</h3>
    <p>
        Binary is a number system with a base of two, meaning that 
        the ones place is 2^0, the next is 2^1, and so on and so fourth.
        The only digits that can be written in binary are 1 and 0.  1 means true, or on.  
        0 means false, or off.  A singular binary digit is called a bit, 4 bits is called
        a nibble (usually used when dealing with hexadecimal), and 8 bits is called a byte.
        This continues on to gigabytes and even terabytes, but these are some of the more common
        names for groups of binary numbers.  Computers understand binary, so it is the foundation
        or all computer programming and languages.  Binary is used by computers to store information.
        Because of this, binary is very important.

    <h3>How do you convert Binary to Decimal?</h3>

        Converting binary numbers to decimal numbers is super simple!  Because 1 is on,
        the value associated with the one in a particular place value is added to the total.
        Nothing is added for the 0 values, because they are off.  The simplest way to perform
        this process, is match the binary digits with its place value.  Like the decimal system,
        the furthest spot to the right begins to the power of 1, and the power
        increases by 1 to the right, continuing for infinity.  Since 2^1 is 1, if the
        number in that slot is equal to 1, it is added.  If not, you add 0, or simply ignore it.
        In this example, the one's slot is equal to 0, so nothing is added.  In the next spot, 2^1 
        equals true (or 1), so it is added to the total.  You repeat this process
        until you get to the 1 furthest to the left.  There you go!  Easy as pi!

        Converting from decimal to binary is a little <i>bit</i> more difficult,
        but I know you'll get the hang of it in no time!  One of the easiest ways to 
        do this, is dividing by 2.  Its nice to do this on paper, so you can visualise what you're
        doing a little bette!  While its not incorrect to draw the division line above the number,
        its easier to track by drawing the line below the number!  Simply divide your number by 2.
        If the number is even, the remainder will be 0.  If not, it will be 1.  When the number is odd,
        subtract one to make it even, and easier to divide!  Take the one you just subtracted, and 
        make the remainder 1.  Continue all the way until you reach 0.  Boom!  Isn't that easy?  
        If you did your division in a column, your remainders will have formed their own column. 
        These numbers are read from bottom to top; so you take the bottom number and make it the furthest
        left binary digit, the second to the bottom the second to the left, and so on.  There you go,
        you just converted a binary number into a decimal!  Congrats!
