                        Well, I'm so glad you asked!  Hexadecimal is acctually pretty neat!
                        Hexadecimal is a base 16 number system.  So, the ones slot is 16^1, the next
                        is 16^2, after that is 16^3, and it so fourth.  Unlike binary, hexadecimal
                        (or <i>hex</i>) can represent both letters and numbers.  0 through 9 are represented
                        by their own values, and then the capital letter "A" is 10.  "B" is 11, "C" is
                        12, and it continues for the rest of the alphabet.  Lowercase letters have different hex
                        values.  Hexadecimal is used to indicate colours.   Colour IDs are made up of 6
                        digits.  The first two characters indicate how red the colour is, the second how green, the third how blue.
                        Every digital picture is made up of these values, so the more details they have, the more hex values they use. 
                        Hexadecimal is important, because they represent colours in most digital things.

                        Good question!  Converting hexadecimal into decimal is acctually quite simple.
                        First, write down each character above its appropriate base 16 slot (16^0, 16^1, 16^2...).
                        Then, write down what that base 16 slot is; so 16^0 is 1.  Then, convert any letters into their
                        appropriate decimal values (A = 10, B = 11, C = 12...).  After that, multiply that value by their
                        base 16 number.  For example, 8 is in the ones space, so it would be multiplied by 1.  After that, 
                        add all the multiplied numbers together.  There you go!

                        Wow, another great question!  Converting a decimal into a hexadecimal is similar to converting
                        a decimal to a binary (see <a href = "binary.html">Binary</a> page).  All you need to do is divide the number
                        by 16, since hexadecimal is a base 16 number system.  When the 16 doesn't easily divide into a number, I like 
                        to take the integer part of the quotient, multiply it by 16, and subtract that from the dividend to find the remaindor.
                        Look at that, you totally did it!  Way to go!
